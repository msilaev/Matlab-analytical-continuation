# Matlab-analytical-continuation
This code computes analytical continuation from imaginary to real frequencies of the response function of the superconductor. 
This code with some variations has been used in several research projects, such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03623, 
https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.224524, https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.224511. 

First, run "SelfCons.m" which calculates the superconducting order parameter. Then, "IsingOptics2D.m" which calculates the linear response, in this case the 
conductivcity.
